    "# Guided Project: Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). We've made some slight modifications to these datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to `UTF-8` (the original ones are encoded using `cp1252`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to answer the following stakeholders' questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns from the `dete_survey.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- `SeparationType`: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `Cease Date`: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `DETE Start Date`: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",

    "Below is a preview of a couple columns from the `tafe_survey.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Record ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",

    "- `LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)`: The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",
